This start gcode requires extrusion set relative. Note: this will be changing entirely at somepoint some 
adjustment may be needed on the prime location y-140  can be tweaked slightly more.  for pure stock or cura 
add StealthChop to the top or SpreadCycle depending on tolerable noise regarding personal preferance. 
Note: in accordance to docs techncially stealthchop may have a tiny movement accuracy issue on paper so spreadCycle is the most 
ideal. I have yet to see this make a noticable differannce other then torque and, trinmatic claims otherwwise. So up for debate.
