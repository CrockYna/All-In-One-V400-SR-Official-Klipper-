############ Prime blob instructions ###########
Not much adjustment should be needed however, the user has the ability to adjust size/extrude length and, retract to avoid stringing. 
Note if blobs don't stick this typically means first layer hotend temp is not hot enough /bed. Generally the print wont stick as well or lift later. 

To change prime blob extrude length/size simply use the "prime blob extrude length macro" click the arrow and change the lenght. the default is 80mm 
To adjust the retract length before it starts print. increase or decrease firmware retract length. 
If coming from a older config simply copy paste firmware retract in the same location as the current printer.cfg file. 
Also replace otherfeatures file with the latest to avoid a full reinstall / calibration cycle.  

Tip: Notepad++ has a compare Tool plugin to aid in slight config changes. refer to google on usage / install.
